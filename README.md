# VRoom
Virtual Reality Classroom

This is a web VR based classroom where a lecturer can broadcast his live video feed and
slides simultaneously. The students attend the lectures in a VR classroom where
they can choose to listen the lecutre in any language of their choice (not only
in the language in which the lectue is being given). The lecturer can also
display 3D models in the VR environment. We are also extracting keywords from the
speech and displaying it alog with their online referece. As the students get
added to the room, they are also represented by human models.
